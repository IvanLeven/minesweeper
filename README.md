# minesweeper
So... I created python version of Minesweeper for console
Hi, glad to see you here! It's basicaly Minesweeper 10x10 for Windwos console writen in Python.
It took me about 7 hours to make and the most time I spent on "Null" section.
It's fully playble and as surprise interesting! :)

(also I have joke .wav files for a title that is parody on "Mattel electronics B-17 bomber")
